I can see the file paths you've provided:

- `C:\\Users\\Aaron - Main\\Desktop\\_OpenCode_MainWorkSpace\\v4\\branches\\devmain`
- `C:\\Users\\Aaron - Main\\Desktop\\_OpenCode_MainWorkSpace\\v5\\branches\\devmain`

However, I can only access files within the current working directory `/`. To work with files in those specific directories, I would need to navigate to them first.

Would you like me to:
1. Navigate to one of these directories and explore what's there?
2. Help you with something specific in one of these workspaces?
3. Or did you have a different task in mind?

Just let me know what you'd like to do with these directories!",
