  "text": "I cannot directly browse or see the contents of file systems or directories. However, I can help you work with these paths using available tools. For example:

1. **Check file/directory existence** - Use the `task` tool with a custom script
2. **List contents** - Use the `task` tool with a command-line utility
3. **Manage files** - Use `read`, `write`, or `edit` tools for specific files

Would you like to perform any operations with these paths?",
