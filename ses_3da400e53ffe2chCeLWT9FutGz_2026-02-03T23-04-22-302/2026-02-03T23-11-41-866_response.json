  "text": "I cannot directly access your local file system or view files on your computer. However, I can help you work with these paths if you provide more context about what you'd like to do (e.g., check file contents, compare directories, etc.). 

For now, I'll confirm I understand the paths you shared:

1. `C:\\Users\\Aaron - Main\\Desktop\\_OpenCode_MainWorkSpace\\v4\\branches\\devmain`
2. `C:\\Users\\Aaron - Main\\Desktop\\_OpenCode_MainWorkSpace\\v5\\branches\\devmain`

Would you like to:
- Check if these directories exist?
- Compare their contents?
- Perform some operation on these paths?
- Troubleshoot an issue related to these directories?

Let me know how I can assist!",
