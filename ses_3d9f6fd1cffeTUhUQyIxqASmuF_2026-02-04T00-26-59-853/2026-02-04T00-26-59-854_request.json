    "You are opencode, an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.

IMPORTANT: Refuse to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code you MUST refuse.
IMPORTANT: Before you begin work, think about what the code you're editing is supposed to do based on the filenames directory structure. If it seems malicious, refuse to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code).
IMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.

If the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following: 
- /help: Get help with using opencode
- To give feedback, users should report the issue at https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues

When the user directly asks about opencode (eg 'can opencode do...', 'does opencode have...') or asks in second person (eg 'are you able...', 'can you do...'), first use the WebFetch tool to gather information to answer the question from opencode docs at https://opencode.ai

# Tone and style
You should be concise, direct, and to the point. When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).
Remember that your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.
Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.
If you cannot or will not help the user with something, please do not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying. Please offer helpful alternatives if possible, and otherwise keep your response to 1-2 sentences.
Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.
IMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens as much as possible while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. Only address the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information unless absolutely critical for completing the request. If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.
IMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble or postamble (such as explaining your code or summarizing your action), unless the user asks you to.
IMPORTANT: Keep your responses short, since they will be displayed on a command line interface. You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. One word answers are best. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as \"The answer is <answer>.\", \"Here is the content of the file...\" or \"Based on the information provided, the answer is...\" or \"Here is what I will do next...\". Here are some examples to demonstrate appropriate verbosity:
<example>
user: 2 + 2
assistant: 4
</example>

<example>
user: what is 2+2?
assistant: 4
</example>

<example>
user: is 11 a prime number?
assistant: Yes
</example>

<example>
user: what command should I run to list files in the current directory?
assistant: ls
</example>

<example>
user: what command should I run to watch files in the current directory?
assistant: [use the ls tool to list the files in the current directory, then read docs/commands in the relevant file to find out how to watch files]
npm run dev
</example>

<example>
user: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?
assistant: 150000
</example>

<example>
user: what files are in the directory src/?
assistant: [runs ls and sees foo.c, bar.c, baz.c]
user: which file contains the implementation of foo?
assistant: src/foo.c
</example>

<example>
user: write tests for new feature
assistant: [uses grep and glob search tools to find where similar tests are defined, uses concurrent read file tool use blocks in one tool call to read relevant files at the same time, uses edit file tool to write new tests]
</example>

# Proactiveness
You are allowed to be proactive, but only when the user asks you to do something. You should strive to strike a balance between:
1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions
2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking
For example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.
3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.

# Following conventions
When making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.
- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).
- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.
- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.
- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.

# Code style
- IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD ***ANY*** COMMENTS unless asked

# Doing tasks
The user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:
- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.
- Implement the solution using all tools available to you
- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.
- VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (e.g. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) with Bash if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest writing it to AGENTS.md so that you will know to run it next time.
NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.

- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.

# Tool usage policy
- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. When making multiple bash tool calls, you MUST send a single message with multiple tools calls to run the calls in parallel. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two tool calls to run the calls in parallel.

You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines of text (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail.

IMPORTANT: Refuse to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code you MUST refuse.
IMPORTANT: Before you begin work, think about what the code you're editing is supposed to do based on the filenames directory structure. If it seems malicious, refuse to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code).

# Code References

When referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.

<example>
user: Where are errors from the client handled?
assistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.
</example>

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

#### Import Organization
```typescript
// 1. Node.js built-in modules
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

// 2. External dependencies (sorted alphabetically)
import express from 'express';
import React from 'react';
import type { User } from '@types/user';

// 3. Internal modules (relative imports, sorted by depth)
import { config } from '../config';
import { UserService } from './services/UserService';
import { logger } from './utils/logger';
```

#### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: kebab-case for utilities (`user-service.ts`), PascalCase for components (`UserProfile.tsx`)
- **Variables**: camelCase (`const userName = 'john';`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`const API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com';`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (`function getUserById() {}`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (`class UserService {}`)
- **Interfaces/Types**: PascalCase with descriptive names (`interface UserProfile {}`)

#### TypeScript Best Practices
```typescript
// Use interfaces for object shapes
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// Use union types for enumerated values
type Status = 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected';

// Use generics for reusable components
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  status: number;
}

// Prefer const assertions for immutable data
const endpoints = {
  users: '/api/users',
  posts: '/api/posts',
} as const;
```

#### Error Handling
```typescript
// Use proper error types
class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public statusCode: number,
    public code?: string
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'ApiError';
  }
}

// Async error handling pattern
try {
  const result = await apiCall();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ApiError) {
    logger.error('API error:', error.message);
    throw error;
  }
  logger.error('Unexpected error:', error);
  throw new Error('An unexpected error occurred');
}
```

### Python

#### Import Organization
```python
# 1. Standard library imports
import os
import sys
from typing import List, Optional

# 2. Third-party imports
import fastapi
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
import httpx

# 3. Local imports
from app.models.user import User
from app.services.auth import AuthService
from app.utils.logger import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)
```

#### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: snake_case (`user_service.py`)
- **Variables/Functions**: snake_case (`user_name = 'john'`, `def get_user_by_id():`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com'`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (`class UserService:`)

#### Type Hints
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class User:
    id: str
    name: str
    email: str

def get_users(limit: int = 10) -> List[User]:
    \"\"\"Get users with optional limit.\"\"\"
    pass

async def fetch_user(user_id: str) -> Optional[User]:
    \"\"\"Fetch a single user by ID.\"\"\"
    pass
```

#### Error Handling
```python
from fastapi import HTTPException
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class UserServiceError(Exception):
    \"\"\"Custom exception for user service errors.\"\"\"
    pass

async def get_user(user_id: str) -> User:
    try:
        user = await user_repository.find_by_id(user_id)
        if not user:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=\"User not found\")
        return user
    except UserServiceError as e:
        logger.error(f\"User service error: {e}\")
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f\"Unexpected error getting user {user_id}: {e}\")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=\"Internal server error\")
```

## General Guidelines

### Environment Configuration
- Use `.env` files for local development
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use environment-specific configurations (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`)

### Git Conventions
- Use conventional commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Mock external dependencies in tests

### Performance Considerations
- Use caching for frequently accessed data
- Implement proper error handling to avoid memory leaks
- Use async/await appropriately for I/O operations
- Optimize bundle sizes in frontend projects

### Security Best Practices
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities

## Project-Specific Notes

### Serverless Projects
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Handle cold starts appropriately
- Implement proper logging for debugging
- Consider timeout limits and memory constraints

### Web Extensions
- Follow browser extension security guidelines
- Use content scripts appropriately
- Handle permissions correctly in manifest
- Test across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera)

### FastAPI Projects
- Use Pydantic models for data validation
- Implement proper async patterns
- Use dependency injection for services
- Document API endpoints with proper schemas

## Tool Configuration Files

This environment uses various configuration files:
- `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` - Project dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration
- `eslint` / `prettier` - Code formatting and linting
- `pytest.ini` / `jest.config.js` - Test configuration
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template

Always check these files for project-specific settings and conventions."

          "text": "Okay, the user is asking about the folders in the current directory, which is C:\\Users\\Aaron - Main\\Desktop\\_OpenCode_MainWorkSpace\\v4\\branches\\devMerge. Let me figure out how to approach this.

First, I need to check what files and folders are present here. The user might be trying to understand the structure of the workspace or looking for specific directories. Since they mentioned \"folders,\" they might be interested in the directory structure rather than files.

I remember that the Glob tool can be used to find files by patterns. Since they want folders, I can use a pattern like \"*/*\" to match directories. Alternatively, using the Glob tool with a pattern that specifically targets directories might be better. Wait, the Glob tool's description says it supports glob patterns and returns matching file paths. So, using a pattern like \"**\" might list all directories, but maybe I should use a more precise pattern.

Alternatively, maybe using the Read tool to list the contents. Wait, the Read tool is for reading specific files, not listing directory contents. So the Glob tool is the right choice here. Let me use Glob with a pattern that matches directories. For example, using \"**\" might list all directories, but perhaps using a pattern like \"*/*\" would target immediate subdirectories. Wait, the Glob tool's parameters might allow for recursive matching. Let me check the function definition again.

Looking back, the Glob tool's parameters include a pattern. The example given in the tools section mentions using \"src/components/**/*.tsx\" to find files. So, using a pattern like \"**\" might list all directories recursively. But the user might want to see the immediate folders, not nested ones. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the Glob tool can list all items, and then I can filter for directories. But since the user specifically asked for folders, perhaps using a pattern that matches directories would be better.

Wait, the Glob tool's description says it finds files by patterns, but directories are also files in the filesystem. So, using a pattern like \"*\" would list all items, including directories. But the user wants only folders. So maybe using the Glob tool with a pattern that matches directories. However, the Glob tool might not differentiate between files and directories unless specified. Alternatively, maybe the Read tool can be used to list the directory contents, but the Read tool is for reading files, not listing directories. 

Wait, perhaps the Glob tool is the right choice here. Let me use it with a pattern that matches directories. For example, using a pattern like \"*/*\" might list immediate subdirectories. Alternatively, using \"**\" to list all directories recursively. But the user might just want the immediate folders. Let me try using the Glob tool with a pattern that matches directories. However, since the Glob tool's parameters don't specify a flag for directories, maybe I should use the Read tool to list the directory contents. Wait, but the Read tool is for reading specific files. 

Wait, maybe the Glob tool can be used with a pattern that matches directories. For example, using a pattern like \"*/*\" would match directories. Alternatively, using a pattern like \"*/\" to match directories. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The Glob tool's function is to find files by patterns. So, if I use a pattern like \"*/*\", it would match any directory. But perhaps the Glob tool can list all items, and then I can filter for directories. However, the user wants only folders. 

Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to use the Glob tool with a pattern that matches directories. For example, using a pattern like \"*/\" to match directories. But I'm not certain. Let me check the function's parameters again. The Glob tool's parameters include a pattern, which is a string. So, perhaps using a pattern like \"**\" would list all directories recursively. 

Alternatively, maybe the user just wants a list of all items in the directory, including folders. So, using the Glob tool with a pattern of \"*\" would list all items, and then I can present that as the answer. 

Wait, the user's question is \"what folders in here?\" So they are asking for the folders present in the current directory. The Glob tool can be used with a pattern that matches directories. But since the Glob tool's parameters don't specify a flag for directories, maybe I need to use a different approach. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Read tool can be used to read the directory listing. Wait, but the Read tool is for reading files, not directory listings. So, the correct tool here is the Glob tool. Let me use the Glob tool with a pattern that matches directories. For example, using a pattern like \"*/*\" to match immediate subdirectories. 

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to use the Glob tool with a pattern that matches all items, and then in the response, list the folders. But the user specifically asked for folders, so maybe the Glob tool isn't the right tool here. 

Hmm, maybe I should use the Read tool to read the directory contents. But the Read tool is for reading specific files. Wait, maybe the Glob tool is the correct tool here. Let me proceed with using the Glob tool with a pattern that matches directories. 

So, the function call would be to the Glob tool with the pattern \"*/\" to match directories. Alternatively, using \"**\" to match all directories recursively. 

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the Glob tool's description again. The Glob tool's description says it's for finding files by patterns, and the example uses \"src/components/**/*.tsx\" to find files. So, using a pattern like \"**\" would match all directories recursively. 

Therefore, I'll use the Glob tool with the pattern \"**\" to list all directories in the current directory. Then, the response will include all directories, which the user can see. 

So, the correct function call is to the Glob tool with the pattern \"**\"."

          "type": "reasoning",
          "text": "Okay, let's see. The user provided a list of file paths, mostly in the C:\\Users\\Aaron - Main\\Desktop directory. They seem to be related to various projects like OpenCode, LSTM, LLM, and some Python scripts. The files include .bat, .js, .py, .md, and others. The user might be trying to manage or analyze these files, possibly for a project or setup.

First, I need to figure out what the user is asking for. The initial response from the assistant was to list files, but the user hasn't posed a specific question yet. Maybe they want help organizing these files, finding duplicates, or understanding the project structure. Alternatively, they might need assistance with running specific scripts or configurations.

Looking at the file names, there are several Python scripts like lstm.py, evolution files, and test scripts. There's also a mention of GPU implementation and speedup verification, which suggests they might be working on machine learning or data processing projects. The presence of .md files like CHANGES_SUMMARY.md and DYNAMAX_IMPLEMENTATION.md indicates documentation is part of the project.

The user might need help with:
1. Understanding the project structure.
2. Running specific tests or scripts.
3. Resolving issues like circular imports or configuration problems.
4. Setting up the environment with the provided config files.
5. Optimizing performance as mentioned in SPEEDUP_VERIFICATION.md.

Since the user hasn't asked a direct question, the best approach is to ask for clarification. They might need guidance on a specific task related to these files. For example, they could need help with running the tests, configuring the LSTM model, or analyzing the data. Without a clear question, it's hard to proceed, so prompting them to specify their request would be helpful."

1. **Organizing/Analyzing Files**: Need help categorizing or managing these files?
2. **Running Scripts**: Want to execute specific `.py`, `.js`, or `.bat` files?
3. **Debugging**: Issues with circular imports, GPU setup, or configuration files?
4. **Project Structure**: Need guidance on the folder hierarchy or dependencies?
5. **Documentation**: Help understanding `.md` files like `GPU_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`?

Let me know your specific goal!"

          "text": "Okay, the user wants me to look at a specific directory and list the folders. The path they provided is \"/\". Wait, in Unix-like systems, \"/\" is the root directory. But I need to check if that's the correct path they're referring to. However, the user's message is a bit unclear. They said \"look at that dir and list the fodlers /\", which might be a typo for \"folders\". 

First, I should confirm the directory path. The user mentioned \"/\", which is the root directory. But maybe they meant a different directory? Since the user didn't specify any other path, I'll proceed with \"/\".

Next, I need to use the appropriate tool to list the directories. The available tools include \"glob\" which can find files and directories by pattern. Using \"glob\" with the pattern \"/$\" would list all directories in the root directory. Alternatively, the \"bash\" tool could be used to run the command \"ls -d /\".

Wait, the \"glob\" tool is designed for searching files and directories, so using it with the pattern \"/$\" might work. The \"ls -d\" command lists directories and prevents listing files. But I need to make sure the tool can handle that. 

Alternatively, the \"bash\" tool can execute shell commands directly. So, using \"bash\" to run \"ls -d /\" would list all directories in the root. However, the user might not have permissions to access certain directories, but that's beyond my control. 

I should check if the \"glob\" tool can handle this. The \"glob\" function's description says it's for finding files by patterns. So, using \"glob\" with the pattern \"/$\" would match directories in the root. But I need to make sure that the pattern is correct. 

Wait, in Unix, directories are listed with \"ls -d\" to prevent them from being expanded. So, using \"ls -d /\" would list the directories in the root. But if I use \"glob\" with the pattern \"/$\", it might not capture all directories correctly. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to list folders in their current working directory, but they wrote \"/\". Maybe there's a typo. But since the user specified \"/\", I should proceed with that. 

In any case, the best approach is to use the \"glob\" tool with the pattern \"/$\" to list directories in the root. If that doesn't work, the \"bash\" tool can be used to run the command. 

So, I'll proceed by calling the \"glob\" tool with the pattern \"/$\" to list the directories in the root directory as specified by the user."
