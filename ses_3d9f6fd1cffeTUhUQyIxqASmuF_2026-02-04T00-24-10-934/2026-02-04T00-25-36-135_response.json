1. **Organizing/Analyzing Files**: Need help categorizing or managing these files?
2. **Running Scripts**: Want to execute specific `.py`, `.js`, or `.bat` files?
3. **Debugging**: Issues with circular imports, GPU setup, or configuration files?
4. **Project Structure**: Need guidance on the folder hierarchy or dependencies?
5. **Documentation**: Help understanding `.md` files like `GPU_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`?

Let me know your specific goal!",
