Use this tool to update the session title when the conversation topic changes significantly.

## When to Use This Tool

You should use this tool proactively when:

1. **Topic Shift**: The conversation has moved to a completely different topic than what the title suggests
2. **User Request**: The user explicitly asks to rename/retitle the session
3. **Better Context**: You've gathered enough information to create a more accurate title than the default
4. **Generic Title**: The session still has a default/generic title (e.g., "New session - 2024-01-21T...") and you now understand what the user wants
5. **Misleading Title**: The current title no longer represents the main focus of the conversation

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Skip using this tool when:
1. The current title is still accurate and relevant
2. The conversation is a natural continuation of the existing topic
3. Only minor clarifications or follow-ups are being discussed
4. The title was recently updated and still applies

## Title Guidelines

When creating a new title:
- Keep it under 50 characters
- Be specific and descriptive
- Focus on the main action or goal
- Use present tense or gerunds (e.g., "Implementing authentication", "Debug production errors")
- Avoid generic words like "the", "my", "a"
- Include technical terms, file names, or specific technologies when relevant
- Don't mention tool names (e.g., don't say "using bash tool")

## Examples

Good titles:
- "OpenCode retitle tool implementation"
- "Debug React rendering performance"
- "Add authentication to API endpoints"
- "Refactor database connection logic"
- "Fix TypeScript type errors in auth.ts"

Bad titles:
- "Coding" (too vague)
- "The user wants to fix the bug" (includes unnecessary words)
- "Using the edit tool to modify files" (mentions tool names)
- "Help me with my code" (too generic)

## Important Notes

- Only call this tool once per significant topic change
- Don't retitle for every single message - only when the topic fundamentally shifts
- The title should reflect the PRIMARY focus of the conversation
- If multiple topics are discussed, focus on the most important or recent one
